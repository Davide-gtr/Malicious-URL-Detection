# Malicious-URL-Detection

### Kolmogorov Complexity Applied to Malicious URL Detection

### Author : Davide Garcia Civiero

One of the most common hacking techniques is "phishing". In order to identify malicious links, Machine Learning algorithms have been developed. Kolmogorov complexity can also be applied to differentiate between benign and malicious links with satisfactory performance.
